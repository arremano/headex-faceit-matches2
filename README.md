Personalized OBS browser source widget to track lifetime FACEIT matches for Headex (can be modified).
To modify for tracking your own matches in OBS - add "?nick=YOURFACEITNICKNAME" (case sensitivity) in the browser source link. (Example: https://arremano.github.io/headex-faceit-matches2?nick=Headex)
I recommend to use 1920x1080 in the browser source width and height
